# Ultimate-tic-tac-toe
Ultimate tic-tac-toe also known as super tic-tac-toe or meta tic-tac-toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3-by-3 grid.Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe board. Strategy in this game is much more conceptually difficult, and has proven more challenging for computers.
